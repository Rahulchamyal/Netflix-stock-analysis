Netflix Stock Analysis Project

Introduction

Welcome to the Netflix Stock Analysis project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's stock performance using Jupyter Notebook and Power BI. As a fresher, this project helped me gain hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization.

Project Overview

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze Netflix's stock data to gain insights into its historical performance. This includes understanding stock prices, trends, and other relevant factors that may impact the company's stock value.

Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook: We will use Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Jupyter Notebook allows for interactive coding and visualization, making it a powerful tool for data science projects.

Power BI: To create visually appealing and interactive dashboards, we will leverage Power BI. Power BI enables us to generate insightful visualizations that can be shared easily.

Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Collection: In this section, we fetch historical stock data for Netflix. We may use APIs or web scraping to obtain the necessary data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Here, we clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is suitable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing any outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In the EDA section, we explore the data to understand its characteristics. We may create visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the stock data.

Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the data. This may involve calculating key statistical measures and performing hypothesis testing.

Machine Learning (Optional): If you are interested in machine learning, this section may include predicting future stock prices using regression models or any other relevant machine learning techniques.

Visualization with Power BI: Transfer key insights and visualizations to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. This step will enhance the presentation of results and facilitate better understanding.

Conclusion

By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in analyzing financial data, performing statistical analysis, and creating compelling visualizations.
